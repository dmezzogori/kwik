This is an audit based on the current state of the Kwik users endpoint, focusing on recent changes and improvements. The audit will highlight areas that need attention, such as security, functionality, and compliance with best practices.
It will also identify any TODOs that need to be addressed in the codebase.
The goal is to ensure that the user management system is robust, secure, and user-friendly, while also providing a clear roadmap for future enhancements.
The audit will cover the following aspects:
1. **User Creation**: Ensure that user creation is secure and that passwords are hashed correctly.
2. **User Profile Management**: Verify that user profiles can be read and updated securely.
3. **Password Management**: Check that password changes are handled securely and that old passwords are validated correctly.
4. **Role Management**: Ensure that user roles can be managed effectively and securely.
5. **Endpoint Security**: Review the security of endpoints to ensure that they are protected against unauthorized access.
6. **TODOs and Improvements**: Identify any TODOs in the code that need to be addressed, such as adding permissions checks or improving endpoint security.
7. **Documentation**: Ensure that the code is well-documented, especially for endpoints that require specific permissions or have security implications.
8. **Testing**: Verify that there are adequate tests for the user management functionality, especially for critical operations like user creation, password changes, and role management.
9. **Compliance**: Ensure that the user management system complies with relevant security standards and best practices, such as OWASP guidelines for secure user management.

All the endpoints should be accessed only by authenticated users with the appropriate permissions.

GET endpoints:
- `/`:
  - Retrieves a list of users
  - Should be protected by `users_management_read` permission
  - Pagination should be implemented to limit the number of users returned in a single request
  - Should return only the necessary user information (e.g., ID, email, roles) to avoid exposing sensitive data
  - Should support filtering and sorting by user attributes (e.g., email, name, surname, is_active)

  - Retrieves the current user's profile
  - Can only return the current user's profile, not other users' profiles

- `/me/roles`:
  - Retrieves the roles of the current user
  - Should return only the roles assigned to the current user
  - Should not expose any sensitive information about the roles

  - Should return only the permissions assigned to the current user
  - Should not expose any sensitive information about the permissions
- `/{user_id}`:
  - Retrieves someone else's user profile by ID
  - Should not be used to retrieve the current user's profile; use `/me` instead
  - Should be protected by `users_management_read` permission
  - Should return only the necessary user information (e.g., email, name, surname) and avoid exposing sensitive data: no roles or permissions should be returned, no ID, no password, no is_active should be returned.
  - It should not be exploited to enumerate users
- `/{user_id}/roles`:
  - Retrieves the roles of a user by ID
  - Should be protected by `users_management_read` and `roles_management_read` permission
  - Should return only the roles assigned to the user
  - Should not expose any sensitive information about the roles
  - It should not be exploited to enumerate users
- `/{user_id}/permissions`:
  - Retrieves the permissions of a user by ID
  - Should be protected by `users_management_read` and `permissions_management_read` permission
  - Should return only the permissions assigned to the user
  - Should not expose any sensitive information about the permissions
  - It should not be exploited to enumerate users

PUT endpoints:
- `/me`:
  - Updates the current user's profile
  - Should not be used to update current user password

  - It should not be exploited to enumerate users
  - It cannot change the user password
- `/{user_id}/update_password`:
  - Updates a user password by ID
  - Should be protected by `password_management_update` permission
  - Should not allow updating the current user's password; use `/me/password` instead

  - It should not be exploited to enumerate users
  - Should be `/{user_id}/password`

DELETE endpoints:
- `/{user_id}/roles/{role_id}`:
  - Removes a role from a user by ID
