## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.1] - 2025-08-21

### Security

- **CRITICAL FIX**: Removed context router endpoints (`/context/settings`, `/context/session`) that exposed sensitive configuration data including JWT secret keys, database credentials, and other application secrets to unauthenticated users.

### Removed

- **Context Router**: Completely removed `src/kwik/api/endpoints/context.py` and all references to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive data.
- **Development Endpoints**: Removed debug/development endpoints that were inadvertently included in production builds.

### Migration Notes

- **Breaking Change**: If your application relied on `/api/v1/context/settings` or `/api/v1/context/session` endpoints, they are no longer available.
- **Immediate Action**: Update to this version immediately if using Kwik 1.2.0 in any production environment.
- **Security Audit**: Review your logs for any unauthorized access to `/api/v1/context/*` endpoints.

## [1.2.0] - 2025-08-20

### Added

- **Configurable Upload Directory**: Added `UPLOADS_DIR` setting to `BaseKwikSettings` with default `"./uploads"` for flexible file storage configuration.
- **Enhanced File Upload Security**: Implemented robust path traversal protection using `pathlib.Path.resolve()` and `relative_to()` methods.
- **Storage Abstraction**: File upload function now returns relative paths for better storage abstraction and portability.

### Changed

- **File Upload Location**: Default upload directory changed from absolute `/uploads` to relative `./uploads` for better cross-environment compatibility.
- **Improved Performance**: Increased file upload chunk size from 1KB to 64KB (64x improvement) for better handling of large files.
- **Enhanced Security**: Replaced brittle string-based path validation with robust pathlib-based directory traversal prevention.
- **Better Error Handling**: Path traversal attempts now raise clear `ValueError` exceptions with descriptive messages.

### Migration Guide

**For users who need the previous absolute path behavior:**
- Set the environment variable `KWIK_UPLOADS_DIR="/uploads"` to maintain the old behavior.
- Alternatively, configure `UPLOADS_DIR="/uploads"` in your settings class.

**API Compatibility:**
- The `store_file` function signature remains unchanged for backward compatibility.
- Return value now includes relative paths instead of absolute paths for better storage abstraction.
- Optional `settings` parameter added but defaults to backward-compatible behavior when not provided.

## [1.1.1] - 2025-08-19

### Changed

- Documentation updated to clarify current synchronous SQLAlchemy 2.x implementation (async support planned for future).

### Removed

- Unused `asyncpg` dependency to reduce install footprint and eliminate confusion about async vs sync implementation.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-01-19

### Added

- Unified `ListQuery` dependency combining pagination, sorting, and filtering for list endpoints.
- Sorting and filtering now supported on users/roles/permissions endpoints via query params.

### Changed

- Default stable ordering applied to listings (primary key ascending) when no `sorting` is provided.
- Invalid sort/filter fields now return HTTP 400 with a clear error message.
